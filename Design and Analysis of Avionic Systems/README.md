# Performance-Analysis-of-a-Helicopter-Mechanism-Design
University Coursework


Performed mechanical analysis on the active inceptor system of a helicopter, using MATLAB to determine limit loads, ultimate loads and to understand if the system will fail due to the applied loads that cause a displacement from its null point. Final analysis showed that across the numerous duty cycles and applied loads the system will not fail even when concerned with margin of safeties loads. Findings included impact analysis, mechanical advantages and the natural frequency which detailed within a concise and well structed report.

Note: Data was supplied by lecturer as well as the code for the Runga-Kutta Method.
Code included is used to calculate the mechanical advantage against input angle and apparent mass against input angle
